# Pen Testing Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1:

Description:

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Description: There is an XSS vulnerability in the "Contact" page. Steps:
1. Click on the contact page and type in a random name and email address (make sure the email address is formatted correctly) (Ex: Name = aaa and Email = a@aa.com)
2. Add an XSS script into the "Feedback" field (Ex: "<script> alert = ("XSS") </script>") and submit the feedback
3. Log in as an authorized user and review the submissions
4. Upon viewing the page, the XSS attack will run and the user's account will be exploited

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Description: There is an IDOR vulnerability in the "Find a Salesperson" section. Steps:
1. Click on the "Find a Salesperson" tab and click on any person on the list
2. At the end of URL, there is an query showing "?id=#", where "#" is the id of the employee
3. Refresh the page and intercept the request using Burp Suite and send it to "Intruder" tab
4. Remove all payloads and add a new one to the number in the URL
5. Brute force numbers from 1-50 until you reach the hidden employee(s)
